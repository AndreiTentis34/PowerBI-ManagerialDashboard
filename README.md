Files

Managerial-Dashboard.pbix — main Power BI Desktop report file

How to open and use

Install Power BI Desktop (recommended latest stable release).

Open Managerial-Dashboard.pbix in Power BI Desktop.

If prompted, configure data source credentials (see Data Sources below).

Use the date slicer and other filters in the header to explore scenarios.

Right‑click points on visuals to drill through or export data as CSV.

Data sources & refresh

The report was designed to support either Import mode (fast offline refresh) or DirectQuery (live backend). If the PBIX contains imported data, replace or update the source files/tables and then click Refresh.

If you plan to publish to Power BI Service, configure scheduled refresh and gateway (for on-premises sources).

Deployment

Sign into Power BI Service.

Publish the PBIX from Power BI Desktop (Home → Publish).

Configure refresh credentials and schedule in the workspace settings.

Share dashboards or create an app for broader distribution.

Troubleshooting

Missing data after refresh: confirm that source tables use the same column names.

Slow performance: consider switching large tables to DirectQuery or optimizing DAX and relationships.

Credential errors on publish: set up an on-premises data gateway if your data is behind a firewall.
